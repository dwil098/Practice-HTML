       <h1>Bone Thugs-n-harmony - Crossroad Lyrics</h1>
       <p> Bone (9x)<br>
        Now tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't no where to run<br>
        When judgment comes for you, when judgment comes for you<br>
        Tell me whatcha gonna do when there ain't no where to hide<br>
        When judgment comes for you 'coz it's gonna come for you<br>
        Let's all bring it in for Wally, Eazy sees uncle Charlie<br>
        Little Boo, God's got him and I'm gonna miss everybody<br>
        I only roll with Bone my gang look to where they lay<br>
        When playing with destiny, play too deep for me to say<br>
        Lil' Layzie came to me, told me if he should decease well then please<br>
        Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me<br>
        God bless you, working on a plan to heaven<br>
        Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, God is who we praise<br>
        Even though the devil's all up in my face<br>
        But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace<br>
        For the case to race with a chance to face the judge<br>
        And I guess my soul won't budge<br>
        Grudge because there's no mercy for thugs<br>
        Oh, what can I do it's all about our family and how we roll<br>
        Can I get a witness? Let it unfold<br>
        We living our lives to eternal our soul<br>
        Hey, and we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray<br>
        Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday<br>
        And we pray and we pray and we pray and we pray<br>
        Still we laced, now follow me roll stroll<br>
        Whether is tell of his heaven<br>
        Come let's go take a visit of people that's long gone<br>
        Wally, Darris, Eazy, Terry, Boo<br>
        It's steadily creeping up on the family<br>
        Exactly how many days we got lasting<br>
        While you laughing we're passing, passing away<br>
        So y'all go rest y'all souls<br>
        'Coz I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroad<br>
        Y'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby<br>
        Now Eazy's long gone<br>
        Really wish he could come home<br>
        But when it's time to die<br>
        Gotta go bye-bye<br>
        All a thug could do is cry, cry<br>
        Why they kill my dog and man<br>
        I miss my uncle Charles y'all<br>
        And he shoudn't be gone, in front of his home<br>
        What they did to Boo was wrong<br>
        Oh so wrong, oh so wrong<br>
        Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong<br>
        When the day comes<br>
        Better believe bone got a shoulder you can lean on<br>
        Hey and we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray<br>
        Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday<br>
        And we pray, and we pray, and we pray, and we pray<br>
        Everday, everyday, everyday, everyday<br></p>
        <p2>
        Chorus<br>
        See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads<br>
        So you won't be lonely (4x)<br>
        And I'm gonna miss everybody<br>
        And I'm gonna miss everybody when I'm gone (3x)<br>
        Living in a hateful world sending me straight to Heaven<br>
        That's how we roll (3x)<br>
        And I'm asking the good Lord "why?" and sigh<br>
        It's I he told me we live to die<br>
        What's up with murder y'all, see my little cousin was hung<br>
        Somebody was really wrong, everybody want to test us dawg<br>
        Then Miss Sleazy set up Eazy to fall, you know why we sinning<br>
        And Krayzie intended on ending it when it ends<br>
        Wanna come again, again and again<br>
        Now tell me whatcha gonna do<br>
        Can somebody anybody tell me why?<br>
        Hey, can somebody anybody tell me why we die, we die?<br>
        I don't wanna die<br>
        Oh so wrong, oh wrong<br>
        <br>
